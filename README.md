# üöÄ Project Name: Hybrid Computer Science Program - Responsive Site Clone (Notion.so)

This project was completed as part of my personal development curriculum, the "Hybrid 4-Year Computer Science Engineering Program," while attending Bah√ße≈üehir University. It fulfills the goals of the Year 1 - Spring Semester, focusing on solidifying my full-stack web development fundamentals.

## ‚ú® Key Achievements and Technical Focus

This project served as a technical exercise to master advanced layout techniques and enforce a professional development workflow.

* **Responsive Design (Mobile-First):** Implemented a fully responsive layout for all major sections (Header, Hero, Grids, Footer), ensuring seamless adaptation to screen sizes down to 320px using **CSS Media Queries**.
* **Advanced CSS Layout:** Extensive use of nested **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** for creating complex, asymmetrical, and multi-column layouts (4x2 card grid, 5-column footer structure).
* **Vanilla JavaScript (DOM Manipulation):** Coded the functionality for the Hamburger menu toggle and the animated mega dropdown menus using pure JavaScript (DOM Events and `classList.toggle`).
* **Professional Git Workflow:** Strict adherence to the Feature Branch methodology, including creating meaningful commit messages, managing and resolving **Merge Conflicts**, and clean branch management.
